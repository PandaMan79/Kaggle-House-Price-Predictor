# My Notebook for the Kaggle Housing Price Prediction

In this notebook I will use a sample dataset provided by Kaggle to determine the house prices based on a number of variables.

I will approach to problem using the following process:

1. Clean & transform the data
2. Analyse data profiling
3. Perform feature importance
4. Run prediction models on the data
6. Determine which is the most accurate model for my submission
